              Development

          <div class="center" style = "margin-bottom:30px">
I decided to create a web application that is dedicated to lipsticks. There are many e-comerce platforms that sell lipsticks however they lack usability principles. In addition there is no filtering or sorting options dedicated to this product. My goal with this web applciation is to create a space for an easy shopping experience and user friendly navigation. With this web application it is easy to click an item and add the item to the card while seeing the shopping card at all times. Look at the video down below to see some of the functionalities of the app.

  Usability
</div>
<div class="center">
  First of all, the web application is fully functional, meaning all the filtering and sorting options, the buttons, the checkout button work. It makes it easier for the user ti know how much she is spending at every point since the card is updating itself every time the user adds or removes an item. The total spending is always on the screen.             </div class = "center">
<div class="par" style = "font-weight: 700; font-size: 30px;">
Learnability and Memorability
</div>
<div class="center">
  This site is fairly learnable because it is super simple. All the filtering and sorting options are laid out in the header and the buttons have descriptive names, making it easier for the user to learn the website. Because this site is easy to learn, it also makes this size easy to memorize. In addition, this website is well organized, on the left side we see the product display and on the right side we see the shopping cart. In addition, this web application is one page making it easier for the user to memorize and understand the overall pattern of the site.
</div class = "center">
<div class="par" style = "font-weight: 700; font-size: 30px;">
Accessability
</div>
<div class="center">
  I choose big fonts and high contrast for this web application so that it is accessible for the user to differentiate between different functionalities of the website.
