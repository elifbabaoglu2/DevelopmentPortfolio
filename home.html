I decided to create a web application that is dedicated to lipsticks. There are many e-comerce platforms that sell lipsticks however they lack usability principles. In addition there is no filtering or sorting options dedicated to this product. My goal with this web applciation is to create a space for an easy shopping experience and user friendly navigation. With this web application it is easy to click an item and add the item to the card while seeing the shopping card at all times. Look at the video down below to see some of the functionalities of the app.

        Conclusion</div>
        <div class="center">
When I played around with the site, I realized even though the responsiveness work, it is quite difficult to center items in certain displays. In addition, the interactive component of the menu buttons are distrupted when the window shrinks. However, the website is still usable! Thank you!                    </div>
